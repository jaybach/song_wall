Sinatra
=============

Upload and vote for (you have to be logged in to vote!) songs.  Listen to the songs by clicking on links to youtube videos or edit the song to add the link if the original poster didn't supply one.

Written in Ruby using a Sinatra framework.  Ruby and HTML only (no CSS - yet!).
